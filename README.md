## A Unity adaptation of The Realistic Terrain Generation mod for Minecraft.

## Credits
This project is a Unity3D C# adaptation of the [RTG Minecraft mod](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/tree/1.10.2-master). RTG is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3) mod by ted80. It was created as a new project because it was expected to deviate from ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.

RTG is brought to you by [Team RTG](https://github.com/Team-RTG) and contains a number of [contributions](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/graphs/contributors) from various members of the Minecraft modding community. It also uses KdotJPG's [OpenSimplex Noise](https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19) to generate its terrain.
